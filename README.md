# Data Wrangling Coursework

This repository showcases my practical skills in data wrangling and manipulation using R. These assignments emphasize my experience with data preparation, iteration, exploratory analysis, and data aggregation techniques.

## Data Preparation and Cleaning

- **Data Transformation**: Utilized `dplyr` functions such as `select()`, `filter()`, `mutate()`, and `arrange()` for efficient data cleaning and preparation.
- **Missing Data Handling**: Implemented techniques to identify and handle missing or incomplete data using functions like `na.omit()` and `is.na()`.
- **Data Tidying**: Applied tidy data principles to restructure data effectively using `tidyr` functions (`pivot_longer()`, `pivot_wider()`).

*Goal*: Ensure datasets are clean, structured, and ready for analysis.

## Iteration and Automation

- **For Loops and Iteration**: Enhanced efficiency through automation of repetitive tasks with R loops and iterative functions such as `lapply()`, `sapply()`, and custom loops.
- **Functional Programming**: Explored functional programming approaches to streamline complex data manipulations.

*Goal*: Automate repetitive processes to increase efficiency and reduce manual errors.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Conducted initial exploration of datasets using summary statistics (`summary()`, `mean()`, `sd()`, `quantile()`).
- **Visualization**: Employed R visualization libraries like `ggplot2` to understand data distributions and relationships visually.

*Goal*: Provide insightful analysis to inform deeper investigation.

## Data Aggregation and Analytical Skills

- **Aggregation Functions**: Used `group_by()` and `summarize()` extensively for data summarization and generating insightful metrics.
- **Analytical Techniques**: Applied analytical methods to summarize, interpret, and draw conclusions from data.

*Goal*: Aggregate data to extract meaningful insights for decision-making.

## Final Project: Comprehensive Data Wrangling

- Combined all acquired skills from data preparation, cleaning, iteration, aggregation, and exploratory analysis to complete a thorough, end-to-end data wrangling project.

*Goal*: Demonstrate comprehensive data wrangling capabilities and proficiency in R for real-world data scenarios.
