# Data_Wrangling

These are the topics that I learned in my data wrangling class. We focused more on the data preparation before the analytical portion. 

### Final Project

For my final project, we were tasked with finding data on a topic that is interesting to us. I am a fan of true crime and mystery. I found a dataset from Kaggle to analyze serial killers through out history.
